# petrol-station-db
PL/SQL petrol station database made on 4th semester of studies for "Advanced Databases" subject.

Hello!
1. File 1_scenariusz.pdf contains description how database works(unfortunately It's in Polish because It's a collage project. If You are not speaking Polish, I'm sure You will get it after execution of all files). 
2. File 2_diagramERD.png contains an image of ERD diagram. To design this diagram I used crow foot notation. It represents whole databases relations, foreign keys etc.
3. To run database You need to execute file named: tabele.sql at first point to create tables in database. Then run 3_skryptDLL.sql - It's an autoincrement script.
4. I made some test entries to database in file 4_insert.sql. You should execute this file to see how other scripts works.
5. File 5_select.sql contains selects, 6a_funkcje.sql - functions, 6b_procedury.sql - procedures, 6c_wyzwalacze.sql - triggers and  	7_pakiet.sql packages. Execute all of them one by one.
6. If u want to drop whole database and scripts execute file named usuwacz.sql
7. Have fun!


Greetings :)
